# EvilGuyV1
Welcome to Evil Guy! This is About a Guy Who Basciclly Releases Hell On Earth, And its You the Players, Job to Stop Him!

Introduction:
Hello My Name is ModifiedWT! Im a Junior in High School and A Film Director. I Love Making Games And Films, This Game in Particular Has Been Something ive Worked on for 4 Years! In Fact I Decided That This will Be My Best Game Yet. 

Why is This Only a V1?:
This Version of the Game is Completly And Always Being Revamped, Eventually This Game Will Be Avalible for People to Download and Enjoy. But Until Then Your Stuck With Me!

Bugs:
Who Likes Bugs? No, Not the Squishy Ones That You Can Kill, Bugs That Break the Game! A Bug Is something That Is Not intended to Happen. For Example if You The Player Go Into a Cave to Fight The Damned Knight and The Damned Knight Is Just Gone, Went On Vacation! [Yes This Bug Actually Has Happened]. Bugs Are Something That Every Game Devolper Runs Into, AND THEY SUCK. I Have Worked on the Damned Knight Bug For 4 Months and Almost didn't Release This Game! But For Me the Devolper to Find These Bugs...Its Not Always the Most Efficent, So Im Hoping That You, Players, Can Help Me With Finding These Bugs.  All I ask is That If You Encounter The Bug, Try to Tell me in any Way you Can!

Problems:
Right Now at the Time of Me Writing this, There are 294 Problems. HOLY COW! Some of these Are Really Just Stuff That Isnt too Important to The Overall Game, and in this Case; You. But I WIll Be trying to Fix These For My Enjoyment.

Conclusion:
In Conclusion, I Ask that All you do is enjoy My Game and I Hope That 4 Years of My Life Havnt Been Wasted! Now Go Player! Defeat The EVIL GUY!
